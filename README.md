# How to use


In one terminal:
```
docker-compose up
```


In another terminal or on your browser, visit the homepage multiple times in a row (fast refresh)

```
http://localhost:4555/
```

Then watch in the first terminal the processor queue up and then process a task each time you visit the homepage.

In your browser, visit:

```
http://localhost:4555/arena/MyAwesomeQueues/test
```

To see the tasks appear in the different states
